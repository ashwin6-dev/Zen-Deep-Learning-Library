# Zen - Deep Learning Library

A deep learning library written in Python. Relies on JAX for calculating derivatives in backprop.

Contains the code for my blog series where we build this library from scratch

* mnist.py contains an example for a MNIST digit recogniser using the library
* rnn.py contains an example of a Recurrent Neural Network which learns to fit to the graph sin(x) * cos(x)
